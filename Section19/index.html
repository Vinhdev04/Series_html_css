        Students have a lot of questions when it comes to writing a paragraph:

        What is a paragraph? A paragraph is a unit of writing that consists of
        one or more sentences, all of which relate to the same topic. Paragraphs
        are essential for organizing long pieces of writing such as novels,
        papers, or even emails. Each paragraph should focus on a single topic.

        How is a paragraph structured? Before we dive into paragraph structure,
        let’s start with paragraph meaning. A paragraph is an individual segment
        of writing that discusses a central idea, typically with more than one
        sentence. It even has its own paragraph symbol in copyediting, called
        the , not to be confused with the section symbol called the that’s
        common in legal code

        The development and support sentences act as the body of the paragraph.
        Development sentences elaborate and explain the idea with details too
        specific for the topic sentence, while support sentences provide
        evidence, opinions, or other statements that back up or confirm the
        paragraph’s main idea.
